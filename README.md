# fluxee 

[WIP] This is a collection of tools written in python that can be used for 
calculating ecosystem fluxes (CO2, H2O, etc), unit and measurement conversions,
statistical analysis (uncertainty, etc), and plotting with environmental data.
Methods have been collected and adapted from various sources and all operations
 should have appropriate references (in docstrings).

## Install

Fluxee requires `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `ruamel.yaml` to work properly. You
can install with pip.

    pip install git+git://github.com/gremau/fluxee@main
